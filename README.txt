The 3rdParty directory contains the necessary lib files, headers and DLLs to build and run Cogmotion. 
Install the full distribution packages for support files.

Boost headers will be added individually as needed, since the whole package is a real beast.

A very thin skeleton of LibCogmatics has been added. It uses the Factory pattern to create machine nodes, all contained within smart pointers.
